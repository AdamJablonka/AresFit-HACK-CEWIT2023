# Ares Fit: A Beginner-Friendly Workout App for Energy Sustainability and Health

Ares Fit is a beginner-friendly workout app created by our team of 3 at the HACK@CEWIT 2023 hackathon. The theme for the hackathon was energy sustainability and health, and we wanted to create an app that would help beginners improve their health and fitness while also contributing to energy sustainability. The app is currently being worked on by the same team behind closed doors, possibly as a finished product by next year!

Our app features a human muscle diagram with clickable areas that display workouts targeting specific muscle groups. This feature is aimed at helping beginners learn about different exercises they can do to target specific muscle groups.

In addition to the workout feature, Ares Fit also has a profile feature that allows users to enlist carpools with other users to reduce carbon emissions. By connecting users who are heading in the same direction, we hope to encourage more eco-friendly practices and contribute to energy sustainability.

Ares Fit is built using React Native for the front-end, Go for the RestAPI, and MySQL for the database. At the moment, only the front-end with React Native has been implemented.
